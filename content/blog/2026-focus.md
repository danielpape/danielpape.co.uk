I’ve always enjoyed using the start of a new year as a moment to reset and refocus — a natural point to step back and be more intentional about what I spend my time designing and improving.

If 2025 was a year of learning, then 2026 is about applying that learning with more confidence. Making clearer decisions. Designing with stronger intent. And spending less time collecting ideas, and more time shaping them into work that feels considered and useful.

Over the last year, I’ve spent a lot of time learning how AI tools fit into my workflow. We’re well past the point of AI being a novelty. The interesting work now is in applying these changes to how we design, build, and maintain products.

This year, I want to be more open about that process. I’ll be sharing what I’m working on, how my thinking is evolving, and how I’m using new tools to support — not replace — design craft.

## My pick of the week

One thing I’ve enjoyed this week is _Adam’s Morning Walk_, a podcast by Adam Wathan, creator of Tailwind CSS.

If you’re interested in web styling, product design, or running a design-led business, it’s well worth a listen. Adam is refreshingly open about the realities of building and sustaining a developer-focused product in 2025.

A recent episode stood out where Adam talks candidly about how LLM-generated code has challenged Tailwind’s monetisation strategy, and the different approaches they’ve explored in response. It’s a thoughtful look at how quickly our tools are evolving, and how design-led products need to adapt to the realities of running a business.

I’ll be sharing more as the year unfolds. If you’re also figuring out how to balance new tools with thoughtful design, I hope something here feels useful.
