        <p>IÂ am a product designer who specialises in service design. User experience is at the heart of everything I produce so you'll usually find me talking and presenting to users, which inform well structured UIs based around a coherent design system.</p>
        <p>I believe in testing over assuming, so I build prototypes with React. You can find some of my prototypes over on <a href="https://codesandbox.io/u/bydanielpape" target="_blank" className="styled-link">CodeSandbox</a>. I also code iOS &amp; Android apps as a hobby, which you can find on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/daniel-pape/id633081961" target="_blank" className="styled-link">App Store</a> &amp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.danielpape.EMOM" target="_blank" className="styled-link">Play Store</a>. In 2013 my first app "Eve Alarm" was featured by Apple &amp; has been downloaded over 100,000 times.</p>
